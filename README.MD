This is a simple Python script to read values from a Kurt J. Lesker KJLC 375 Series Panel Mount Gauge controller. In addition there is a MatPlotLib script that will plot these values.

It is quite likely that additional vacuum gauges will also work with these scripts, as KJLC reports their serial protocol is the same as used in other devices.

In order to use your KJLC375 with a standard serial port or USB to serial convertor, it is required to make a simple adapter cable. You can folllow pinouts found in the manufacturer documentation.
